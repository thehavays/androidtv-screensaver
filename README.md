# AndroidTV Screensaver

## Adding Images

Add images to **drawable** folder and also add to contents array that located in images_array.xml


## Adding Video

Add videos to **raw** folder and also add to contents array that located in images_array.xml


### Working Logic

The app will fetch the contents array and shuffle it. After that content will be displayed randomly. Images take 10 seconds to display. Videos will be playing until finished.
